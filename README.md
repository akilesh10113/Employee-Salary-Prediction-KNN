# 🧠 Predicting Employee Salary Classification Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict whether an employee will earn a salary above 50K based on various features such as Age, Education, Capital Gain, and Hours Worked per Week.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes:
- **Age**: Employee's age
- **Education**: Level of education
- **Capital Gain**: Capital gain amount
- **Hours per Week**: Hours worked per week
- **Salary**: Whether salary exceeds 50K (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

This is a binary classification problem.

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn (sklearn)

## ⚙️ Project Steps
- Data preprocessing and exploration  
- Feature scaling using **StandardScaler**
- Train-Test split  
- Fitting KNN classification model  
- Predicting outcomes for test data  
- Confusion matrix and accuracy evaluation  
- Predicting salary category based on new employee inputs  

## ✅ Model Accuracy
The KNN model achieved an accuracy of **79.96%** on the test dataset.
